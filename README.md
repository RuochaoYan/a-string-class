## Preface

We've spent the last few weeks covering the intricacies of C++ classes in considerable detail. Now it's your turn to create your first meaningful class.

## Welcome to JobCo!

You've just started your new internship at JobCo, a chic software company in the heart of Silicon Valley that sells party balloons with integrated block-chain tracking. You've met your new manager, Chloe, who introduces you to the rest of the team. As you are wisked through the office, you race past a herd of zombies that are wandering aimlessly in the basement. "Oh my goodness", you say, in disbelief.  "Don't let them bother you", Chloe says smiling, "that's just the marketing department taking a lunch break". JobCo is going to be very interesting.

### Your FIRST Sprint Meeting

The next morning you get to sit in on your very first "Sprint Meeting" where the team discusses the work they're going to accomplish for the week. Each of the engineers talks briefly about their challenges and expected output. At last, all eyes drop onto you. Before panic seizes you, Chloes says, "Hey everyone, this is our new summer intern!". The team smiles knowingly, suggesting you may be in for more than you bargained for.  What happens next is mostly a blur. For one, you don't remember actually saying anything. But suddenly you realize that Chloe has tasked you with creating some mission critical code, and FAST!  

### Your Team Makes a Decision

Just before the end of the standup meeting, Morris (a performance engineer) raises the topic of how slowly the application is performing. "Seriously", he says, "the app is running 5x slower today than it was a month ago". "What we need", he continues, "is someone to rewrite our string class to stop all the unnecessary memory allocations and performance problems."

"Great -- our new intern can build us a new string class this Sprint!", Chloes exclaims, never missing an opportunity. Sade, a UX designer on the team, says, "Hold on, why can't we just use the std::string class provided by the STL? Won't that be cheaper than building our own?"  Morris can barely contain himeself. "No!", he chides, "the STL is great in general, but it's way too big, and I just know we can build something smaller and faster!"

Sadly, no amount of arguing about re-inventing the wheel would stop Morris and Chloe from building their own string class. Welcome to Silicon Valley. :)
