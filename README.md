## Preface

We've spent the last few weeks covering the intricacies of C++ classes in considerable detail. Now it's your turn to create your first meaningful class.

### On Writing Code

You’re going to be writing and debugging lots of code in this class. In nearly every case, we have two objectives in mind:
1. To give you experience with the many new idioms in Object-oriented development with C++
2. To help you to learn to think like a software developer. 

As important as learning the C++ language may be, we believe that it’s even more important that you learn the conceptual language of software design.  How you think about the problems you’ll face is often the most important factor in whether you can craft a software solution.  

Take time to reflect on these assignments, and consider the larger concepts — before you start writing any code.  Remember that a fundamental advantage of object-oriented programming is that these techniques allow us to more easily reason about the problem space.  So, take some time to consider the relationships between key elements in the problem space, and how you might synthesize them into a working model.  During this phase, it’s a great idea to chat with peers and instructors on concepts you’re working through. Software design is a team sport.
